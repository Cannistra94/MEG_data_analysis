# MEG Data Analysis

This repository contains scripts and pipelines for the preprocessing and analysis of MEG data. Specifically, it includes:
Data Preprocessing: Procedures to clean and prepare raw MEG recordings for further analysis, including filtering, artifact removal, and channel selection.
Power Spectra Analysis: Computation of power spectral density for each brain region, enabling investigation of regional oscillatory activity.
Connectivity Analysis: Functional connectivity metrics are calculated between regions to study network interactions and brain dynamics.
These tools provide a comprehensive workflow from raw MEG recordings to region-wise spectral and connectivity analyses, facilitating reproducible and standardized MEG research.
